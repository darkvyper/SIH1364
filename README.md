### Abstract

While hundreds of individuals have benefited from the immense sources of information made available by the Internet and social media, there has been a massive increase in the emergence of cyber-crime. According to a 2019 study in the Economic Times, India experienced a 457% increase in cybercrime between 2011 and 2016. Most people believe this is because of the influence of social media platforms like Instagram on our daily life. While they obviously aid in the formation of a solid social network, the creation of user accounts on these sites usually requires only an email address.Impostors can be simply created when a real individual creates many bogus IDs. In contrast to the real world, where various laws and regulations are imposed to identify oneself in a unique fashion (for example, when issuing one's passport or driver's license), entrance to the virtual world of social media is not required. In this project, we look at Instagram accounts in particular and try to determine whether they are phony or real.
